# RISC-V Green Card
An unofficial reference card for RISC-V, the free and libre ISA from Berkeley.

## Modified for CASS @ KU Leuven
This is a reduced sheet of the original. Feel free to reuse/change without mentioning our attributions or changes but please respect the original author's license.

## Why?

I wanted a better assembly reference card for my [CS 61C][CS61C] course at UC
Berkeley that I didn't have to squint at. The original intent was to print the
full base ISA and register calling convention on a single double-sided page.
This is still possible by printing the first and last pages.

The provided [green card][CS61C-card] from our
[RISC-V textbook][patterson-hennessy] is (now) available in high-resolution pdf
scans, but is not text-friendly. Information not specific to RISC-V
architectures, like the stack/heap memory layout, IEEE 754 floating-point
layout, and size prefixes, is omitted.

## Contributing

This repository is not actively developed, but pull requests are accepted, for
fixes, new ISA standard extensions, style improvements, or other such changes.
Please include a rebuilt PDF binary in your pull request.

Print-friendly format is preferred, when possible: legible font sizes, clean
page breaks and letter page width utilization.
(A4 support may be a good thing to check.)

Some ideas if you are truly motivated:
- Multiple outputs (pdfs) for different domains / ISA extension sets, or for 32
  / 64-bit support
- Directly parsing the spec, banishing typos forever
- Build system to select binary or hex instruction opcodes
- Other ISA support? (probably only feasible for RISC ISAs)
